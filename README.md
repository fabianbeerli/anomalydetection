# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in S&P 500: A Comparative Approach

## üìà Project Overview
This project performs a comparative analysis of three unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms ‚Äî **AIDA**, **Isolation Forest**, and **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** ‚Äî applied to S&P 500 stock data. The project evaluates their effectiveness in identifying anomalous patterns in financial time series using three analysis approaches:

1. **Individual Subsequence Analysis**: Detecting anomalies in temporal windows of single stocks
2. **Cross-Index-Constituent Analysis**: Examining relationships between index anomalies and constituent stock behavior
3. **Multi-TS Matrix Analysis**: Analyzing anomalies across multiple stocks simultaneously (matrix-based approach)

## üì¶ Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- C++ Compiler with OpenMP support (e.g., `g++`)
- Homebrew (for macOS users to install OpenMP)
- Recommended: Python virtual environment

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### 1. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. macOS Users: Install OpenMP Support (Required for AIDA)
```bash
brew install libomp
```

## üöÄ Workflow

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Data Retrieval & Processing
Download and prepare S&P 500 index and constituent stock data.
```bash
# Retrieve raw data
python scripts/retrieve_data.py

# Process and create features, subsequences, and matrices
python scripts/prepare_data.py
```

### ü§ñ Step 2: Run Complete Analysis
Execute the complete analysis workflow with one command:

```bash
# Run the complete analysis with default settings
python scripts/run_complete_analysis.py --run-all

# Customize with specific settings
python scripts/run_complete_analysis.py --run-individual-analysis --run-cross-analysis --run-multi-ts-analysis --window-sizes 3,5 --algorithms aida,iforest,lof
```

#### Alternative: Run Each Analysis Type Separately

```bash
# Individual Subsequence Analysis
python scripts/run_subsequence_algorithms.py --window-size 3 --overlap --algorithms all

# Cross-Index-Constituent Analysis
python scripts/run_constituent_relationship_analysis.py

# Multi-TS Matrix Analysis
python scripts/run_matrix_analysis.py
```

### üìä Step 3: Compare and Visualize Results

```bash
# Compare subsequence anomalies
python scripts/compare_subsequence_anomalies.py --window-size 3 --overlap-type overlap

# Analyze constituent relationships
python scripts/analyze_constituent_relationships.py

# Compare multi-TS anomalies
python scripts/compare_multi_ts_anomalies.py --window-size 3 --overlap-type overlap --data data/processed/index_GSPC_processed.csv
```

## üß† Run Scripts with Convenience Helpers

The project includes convenience scripts for Windows and Unix systems:

### Windows (Batch Files)
```
scripts/run_analysis.bat          # Run complete analysis
scripts/run_constituent_analysis.bat  # Run constituent analysis
```

### Unix (Shell Scripts)
```
scripts/run_analysis.sh           # Run complete analysis
scripts/run_constituent_analysis.sh   # Run constituent analysis
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Algorithms

### üîπ AIDA (Analytic Isolation and Distance-based Anomaly)
A parameter-free anomaly detection method that combines distance and isolation principles, providing robust detection across different data distributions.

### üîπ Isolation Forest
An efficient algorithm based on the principle that anomalies are easier to isolate in feature space, performing well with high-dimensional data.

### üîπ Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
A density-based algorithm identifying local deviations in density, effective at detecting context-dependent anomalies.

---

## üîé Analysis Methods

### Individual Subsequence Analysis
Detects anomalies in temporal windows (subsequences) of individual stock time series, identifying unusual price and volume patterns.

### Cross-Index-Constituent Analysis
Examines how anomalies detected in the S&P 500 index relate to anomalies in constituent stocks, identifying market-wide vs. stock-specific patterns.

### Multi-TS Matrix Analysis
Treats multiple stock time series simultaneously as a matrix, detecting anomalies in collective market behavior that might be missed when looking at stocks individually.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### AIDA Compilation Issues
- **macOS**: Make sure OpenMP is installed (`brew install libomp`)
- **Windows**: Use MinGW or another compiler with OpenMP support
- If issues persist, run with other algorithms: `--algorithms iforest lof`

### Common Issues
- Ensure data directories exist with proper permissions
- For OpenMP-related errors, verify that C++ compiler supports OpenMP
- If you see "Segmentation fault" with AIDA, try reducing the window size
